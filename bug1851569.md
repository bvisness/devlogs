# i31 cast bug (SECURE) (Bug 1851569)

Ok, this is a bug that I already looked at a bit ago because Julian was doing it. But since I managed to fix the issue, the bug has been assigned to me and I'll be finishing it up.

The actual security fix was easy - however, as I work through other stuff from cast-abstract, I'm finding other issues. Unclear if they should be in the same patch, but I can decide how to ship these fixes later.

Shipped 'em all at once. Easy.
