# Global import types (bug 1848006)

[x] Change the "type" of GlobalDesc to be the declared value type instead of the return type of the InitExpr
[x] Add the subtype check for immutable globals
[x] Add more exhaustive tests for global matching

Right now we are doing a strict equality check when importing globals. This is not correct, sometimes.

As of the GC proposal, the matching rules for globals are laid out here: https://webassembly.github.io/gc/core/valid/matching.html#global-types. Mutable globals do in fact require strict type equality; this is because if module A has (mut (ref $child1)) and module B has (mut (ref $parent)), module B could mutate the global to a value of type (ref $child2), violating A's type. However, immutable globals are not subject to this restriction; an immutable global of type (ref $child1) could be imported as type (ref $parent) with no issues since the value can never change anyway.

Oh boy, this is even more broken than I thought.

```js
const { g } = wasmEvalText(`(module
  (type $s (struct))
  (global (export "g") (mut (ref struct)) (struct.new $s))
)`).exports;

wasmEvalText(`(module
  (global (import "test" "g") (mut (ref struct)))
)`, { "test": { "g": g } });
```

This should obviously work because the exported global and importing global have the same type - (mut (ref struct)). But this actually doesn't work, and do you know why? It's because the exported global actually is being treated as having type $s. ðŸ˜±

I got subtype'd before I even got started, basically. Wild.

The type() method of GlobalDesc (not a global object?) just gets the type of the global's InitExpr, hence this problem. That's obviously wrong, but...hang on, how does this work for mutable globals?

I'll have to keep asm.js happy on this one...not looking forward to that.

There are three values for GlobalKind - Import, Constant, and Variable. Constant and Variable seem to be immutable and mutable, generally, judging by the constructor of GlobalDesc. Uh, although the constructor is weird...when you construct a global with an InitExpr, you can pass in an `isMutable` param, but if the InitExpr is not "literal" (constant...?), then it ends up "Variable" regardless. Even if you passed isMutable = false. What?

Alternatively, you can construct a GlobalDesc as an import, in which case it is always kind Import and gets a new InitExpr that is just a literal value of the provided type...? What does that even mean? Ah, LitVal has a constructor that produces the zero value of the given type, so 0 for numbers and nullptr for refs. Although it doesn't seem to care if the ref is nullable or not, which is cool. Maybe in this case it doesn't matter because you're never actually running the InitExpr for the global, since it's imported? Spooky though. Maybe if I add an explicit ValType to GlobalDesc, I can drop that dummy InitExpr.

(The dummy InitExpr feels spooky to me because I feel like at some point it could get run, produce a nullptr for a non-nullable type, and then wreak havoc somewhere in another module. Seems very plausible actually.)

Just for fun, I'm dropping a MOZ_ASSERT into the LitVal constructor to see if we're creating nulls for non-nullable types. ...Boy, are we ever. Very spooky. Now I'm testing if we're actually accessing the AnyRef value of these LitVals in these situations. Seemingly not, thankfully, although it's possible that we don't always access it via the ref() function.

So I think the fix for this is two-stage, see the top of the file.

Ok step 1 might have been really easy. Let's see how our tests are faring. A global of type structref, of actual type structref, is allowed to be imported to a global of type structref but not eqref or anyref. Maybe I could make this test better by referencing a concrete struct, actually...

Great this already doesn't work. Bad test! (And bad fix.)

I don't see how the type of the global itself could be wrong at this point, so I suspect it's now the type of the WasmGlobalObject. The type of the WasmGlobalObject comes from a "Val". Which is...I don't know what that is. Apparently "a Val is a LitVal that can contain (non-null) pointers to GC things". I think this must be coming from the InitExpr again.

God I wish I had a back button in my IDE. I never know where the hell I was.

EnsureExportedGlobalObject seems like the right place for this to happen. But weirdly it seems it's constructing a Val from the GlobalDesc type, which I now fixed! I thought! Will probably debug this to see if it's actually happening.

It is happening. And strangely, at the point of creating the object, we do see structref. But when we import the global, we suddenly see...well, I'm not sure what we see. Not structref. I think it's probably a concrete type from the first module. A few extra printfs indicate that this is true. So, where is this coming from?

EnsureExportedGlobalObject is the only path by which WasmGlobalObjects are created in this test. Oh, the value slot is in fact still created from a LitVal without an explicit type. That would do it. I guess this means that the val is coming from globalImportValues[globalIndex] - which, yeah, that makes sense, this is happening on the import side.

Seems like the way to fix this would be to improve the Vals in globalImportValues to store an actual value type. The class supports this, so this should be doable. This seems like a weird chicken and egg problem, though - the vals are added to imports->globalValues after I do the part that's failing!

So maybe I traced this wrong. The WasmGlobalObject itself seems to have the bad type. Oh, right - EnsureExportedGlobalObject is getting the type for the WasmGlobalObject from the exporter. Let me go back to look at that. Well...I already verified that the types were correct there, though. How is this happening?

After creating the WasmGlobalObject, type() returns structref as expected. Then when I import it, type() returns some concrete type. How does it change? After all, we're just passing the WasmGlobalObject from one module to the other.

The values being used throughout WasmGlobalObject creation all seem completely rock-solid. We create a Val from the type of the GlobalDesc, which is correct. It seems like everything must be external to this. What maybe _is_ confusing is that we save the WasmGlobalObject to an array called globalObjs - which, when we trace up the chain, maps to `imports.globalObjs` on a WasmModule. So are we doing this from the exporter or the importer? Does it matter? I think we must be on the exporter, since we wouldn't be doing this in `instantiateGlobals` if we didn't have a _global section_, right? Well, maybe we run it unconditionally...

After much runaround I think I've found the problem - we mutate the WasmGlobalObject's val() in GetGlobalExport - by setting it to the result of evaluating the InitExpr. This makes sense, I suppose - EnsureExportedGlobalObj just _creates_ the WasmGlobalObject but clearly didn't set a value, because it never actually did anything but create a null Val().

Because of this, Ryan found a bug! We are running the global's InitExpr when exporting it, but we actually shouldn't do that because some of our globals have identity now (GC objects). I need to make a test that round-trips a global value to catch this.

Two birds with one stone! Changing GetGlobalExport to fetch the global's value from the instance seems to have fixed the mutation issue too. Let me just confirm why.

I guess it's because the GC stuff is not "literal" in the context of an InitExpr, and in that case we just look up the actual stored value and use the GlobalDesc's type. Works for me.

Well, we might not be out of the woods yet. When the struct is mutable, we're back to the same issue. My hunch is that this is related to "constant" vs. "variable" globals. And in fact it does seem like this is probably coming from constantGlobalGet...it basically has to.

If the global is mutable or not a literal, it comes in as "variable". Otherwise it comes in as "constant". Therefore both globals in this test come in as "variable". I'm gonna flip the logic so it's clearer...

Ok, so it's not that. We're still getting a value from the instance the same way as before. Again we seem to be mutating - but how, this time? Is this a type mixup in the instance's cell? The type is determined by the global though...but, the GlobalDesc has anyref?? What? Seems like we're skipping a global here...need to figure out why.

The mutable globals are "indirect". Apparently. What does that mean? Ah, it means they're _not_ stored in any instance at all - they're stored on the WasmGCObject itself! Clearly we're mishandling the type somewhere in that process too. Except, again, it seems _fine_ at the time of object creation, right?

Well...no, that can't be right. When is it actually initialized? After creation it still stores a null pointer. I need to see what's different about indirect globals.

Ok yeah. When we initialize a module the global gets initialized, but by a different path. And here we are again, with a Val that has the wrong type, because it came from an InitExpr and I can't impose a new type. I think I just need to wedge that into InitExpr evaluation itself, or just add a way to modify a Val's type. The latter is probably the most reasonable.

I uh

why are all the tests passing now? what? that makes no sense...

Oh, no, this is actually fine. The cases that are still failing are the subtype ones. I didn't realize that all my other tests didn't actually exercise subtyping, but it makes sense - the (mut structref) and (mut anyref) ones don't expect subtyping because mutable, and the anyref one expects only anyref == anyref to work, since I picked the toppest type.

Uncommenting the structref <: eqref and structref <: anyref tests results in failures. Thank goodness.

Ok, so that did work. Modifying the type stored in the Val when evaluating a global's InitExpr fixes it. But the way I'm doing it (a setter on Val) feels fragile. I feel like I should maybe have a way of evaluating a global's InitExpr that always assigns the type correctly. Let me see where the InitExpr is even evaluated, though.

One place! Just this one place. Not bad at all. Doing the setter like I did seems pretty reasonable then.

Now just subtyping. Just subtyping...just subtyping. Fingers crossed.

Easy.

Ok, well, I did break some other tests. So there's that. Gotta fix that.

69 failures. Nice. They all seem to be the same thing, some assertion inside Instance::init. Seemingly it's the new setType I'm doing. It might just be a bad assert, but also, uh, the assert is claiming that one type or the other is invalid. Why?

Let's take unreachable.wast.js as an example. It only has one global, conveniently. It's a (mut f32) initialized with f32.const 0. You...really wouldn't expect this to fail. Does this subtype check not play nice with mere f32s though?

Oh, it's just a problem with serialization. I can handle this.

Already done.

There are still a few failures. Maybe a legitimate subtype-related thing now. Interesting. Just two actually, in wasm/function-references/non-nullable.js. Again there is only one global - very convenient. It's of the form (global (ref func) ref.func $f). So...wait, surely function subtyping is ok? Did I just get the types backwards?

Oh, it's actually slightly different from what I thought. The message I printed for myself is "type is going from funcref -> (ref func)". ACTUALLY WTF why is this valid? Why does this test pass? This test shouldn't pass! Right??

Uh actually it should. There are a couple layers of wrong here. In an initializer expression, ref.func is currently producing (ref null func) instead of (ref <func type>) This is super duper wrong! But because we also weren't enforcing global types in any meaningful way, this passed. Now I fixed the subtype stuff, and this pops up.

Something something I fixed it I dunno moving on

k done great devlog

---

Coming back to fix comments and get it landed.

Wasn't too bad. Needed to keep the logic that explicitly sets a Val's type, but just moved it as far inside the InitExpr process as I could. We now need to explicitly pass a type whenever we evaluate an InitExpr, but that's fine, we always have one.
