# GC array instructions (bug 1851864)

Time to implement three instructions in a week...in one patch? Multiple patches? Who knows.

I have not been maintaining this devlog at all but I have all three instructions implemented on baseline. array.fill ended up being the hardest, strangely, because of the need to handle so many types of values, including v128 - which is too big to be passed as a single value in the instance call ABI. Ryan and I hacked around this with a `u8[16] data` and `size_t size` on WasmInstance.

Time now to add all three to Ion.

setupForArrayAccess will do the common bounds checking and stuff - it won't be directly useful because the bounds check isn't for a single index, but the logic is similar.

createArrayNewCallAndLoop is the template to follow.
