# Bug 1879096 (stack types in br_on_cast)

So - we are validating something that should not validate.

It seems we should start by reproducing the example in the bug, and then flesh that out to more test cases. There are probably multiple branch/cast instructions that have this problem.

Ok, got some test cases written up. This is gross but kind of just a curiosity anyway. In principle it shouldn't affect codegen quality, only validation - we can track more precise type info than the validation rules in the spec.

This was really easy to fix. There were a few places where we were doing rewriteStackTypes=false where we should have done rewriteStackTypes=true.
