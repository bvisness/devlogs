# Bug 1884572 (slow LZ4 encoding)

Actually kind of an interesting case. It is just one chunky wasm function, that's it. Makes me wonder if we're even tiering, actually.

This really is a very simple case. It seems to be very straightforward wasm, without even any fancy control flow. It's kinda just crunching. In fact, it's surprising then that we'd have an appreciable performance difference here.

I'm not really sure how to approach the performance of a program like this...but this is probably as good a case as any to learn on.

Well, converting arbitrary wasm/js stuff for the browser to the shell is asinine and annoying, but I got it done and got it through iongraph. So that's nice. Hopefully. I know that it's wasm function 2 in the profiler; thankfully the iongraph function numbers seem to correspond to wasm function numbers! As such, the following command now works great:

```
iongraph js -f 2 -- lz4-block-codec-wasm.js
```

Now - this is indeed a chunky function and will take me a while to pick through. I'm not sure I'll actually learn anything interesting, but I guess we'll see. It doesn't even shrink much in optimizing - I'd wager that this was already compiled from C++ with decent optimizations.

Huh - it's actually handwritten wasm: https://github.com/gorhill/lz4-wasm/blob/master/src/lz4-block-codec.wat

That is, it's handwritten wasm that's been plumbed through wasm-opt. That's fine, I guess. At least I have annotated wasm to look at. And I guess this explains the use of local.tee.

Julian walked me through his whole valgrind profiling workflow. It is a hot mess but it does give me very useful info. When running on a real workload, we do indeed see the function in question being quite hot, and just four basic blocks making up 99% of basic block hits.

The stats:

```

Now, a few notes. r14 is the instance register, and the loop interrupt check is at offset 64. So we already know that block 2 is just the loop interrupt check. The other blocks are more interesting as they form the actual hot loop we saw in the [iongraph](func02.pdf). The correspondence, I think, is:

- SB rank 0 == block 24
- SB rank 1 == block 25
- SB rank 2 == block 24 again (?)
- SB rank 3 == block 26

I actually do think this all makes sense because the `wasminterruptcheck` has a branch in it, thus splitting a single LIR basic block into multiple machine basic blocks. So it's something like:

- SB rank 2 == block 24.1
- SB rank 0 == block 24.2
- SB rank 1 == block 25
- SB rank 3 == block 26

And so we have our hot loop. Now - the problem is actually pretty obvious. This is the hottest loop in the function _by far_ and the register allocation is awful. It has spilled most things to the stack and therefore is just thrashing memory for no reason.

Why does this workload hit this loop so hard? Dunno, really. Here's the [source wat](https://github.com/gorhill/lz4-wasm/blob/master/src/lz4-block-codec.wat) that produced this loop:

```wasm
  block $endOfMatch loop      ;; scan input buffer until match ends
      get_local $inPtr
      get_local $inPtrEnd2
      i32.ge_u
      br_if $endOfMatch
      get_local $inPtr
      i32.load8_u
      get_local $refPtr
      i32.load8_u
      i32.ne
      br_if $endOfMatch
      get_local $inPtr
      i32.const 1
      i32.add
      set_local $inPtr
      get_local $refPtr
      i32.const 1
      i32.add
      set_local $refPtr
      br 0
  end end $endOfMatch
```

Now, I don't actually know how lz4 works, but at least we can clearly see that's it's just looping over memory looking for the end of some pattern. Presumably for this input it does this a lot. And rather than just incrementing the values in registers as it loops, it loads and stores to the stack. Disastrous.
