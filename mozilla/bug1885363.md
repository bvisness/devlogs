# Bug 1885363 (merge ModuleEnvironment and Metadata)

So ModuleEnvironment and Metadata have grown to be almost identical. ModuleEnvironment is the module-specific version of the info, designed to be used on module creation, i.e. the ahead-of-time compile. Metadata on the other hand is the instance-specific data. These have gravitated toward each other strongly as more wasm features have blurred the line between ahead-of-time and runtime, and if we want to do speculative optimizations, we need to be compiling at runtime anyway, so the module/instance distinction is somewhat moot. The two types can be collapsed to one.

In fact, Ryan said that the only information missing on Metadata is the vector of `FuncDesc`s used for compiling functions. I need to verify this since I also don't see data segments.

Present in both:

- Types (MutableTypeContext vs. SharedTypeContext)
- Memories (MemoryDescVector)
- Globals (GlobalDescVector)
- Tables (TableDescVector)
- Tags (TagDescVector)

Present only on ModuleEnvironment:

- Data segments (DataSegmentEnvVector) (this must be available to instances somehow!)

Present only on Metadata:

- Filename / sourceMapURL (presumably for debugging, where does it come from?)

Relevant places for copying from one to the other:

- ModuleGenerator::finishMetadata

Questions:

- If a ModuleGenerator creates a Metadata in the process of creating a wasm module, and seemingly only does so when compiling for baseline, how does it compile "tier 2" (presumably Ion) functions?
-

Notes from Ryan:

- Lifetime of ModuleEnvironment === lifetime of compilation (including tier 2). Freed when compilation is done.
  - Tier 2 background task gets reference to ModuleEnvironment and keeps it alive for tier 2 compilation.
- Things for instantiation get transferred to the module object. (e.g. active data segments)
- Things on ModuleEnvironment:
  - If not needed after compilation, dropped
  - If needed for instantiation, put on Module
  - If needed for instantiation and Instance, put on Metadata
- Instance needs to keep JIT code alive
  - JIT code is kept alive through Code and CodeTier
  - Code owns CodeTier, CodeTier owns ModuleSegment, ModuleSegment keeps JIT code alive
  - CodeTier stores the "intepreter entry", a trampoline with C++ ABI that is the entry point for JS into wasm
  - GenerateEntryStubs generates entrypoints for ?????, done during compilation
  - When the JS interpreter calls into wasm (via an exported function), it goes through WasmCall, which calls Instance::callExport, which needs to get an interpreter entry, the location of which is stored on the MetadataTier, which is on the CodeTier, which is in Code, which finally is on Instance.
- Unsure why Metadata and Code are separate, same with MetadataTier and CodeTier. They have the same lifetime.
- We are going to want the module environment to be serialized and deserialized and then compilation done in a later session. So at that point it makes more sense for all that data to live directly on the module / metadata.

Names of things:

- ModuleEnvironment
- Module
- Instance
- Code
- Tier
- Metadata
  - All the stuff from ModuleEnvironment that isn't tier-specific, and is necessary at runtime
- MetadataCacheablePod
- MetadataTier
  - Metadata associated with JIT code, e.g. stack maps


Tier 1 may be either baseline or ion!

Sketch of refactor:

- Create FuncModuleEnvironment by pulling out all the things from ModuleEnvironment that are needed for function compilation
- Embed FuncModuleEnvironment in ModuleEnvironment
- Replace several things in Metadata with FuncModuleEnvironment

---

Ok. Chaotic notes shall remain above that line. Time to figure out what information is actually necessary for function compilation, since that is at the heart of this refactor idea.

I think that means looking at all the fields on ModuleEnvironment that are used by WasmOpIter, WasmBaselineCompile, and WasmIonCompile. And WasmValidate. (Wait - maybe not all of WasmValidate. Much of this is module validation only.)

WasmOpIter:
- types
- funcs
- features
- globals
- numGlobalImports
- tags
- memories
- tables
- dataCount
- elemSegments
- gcEnabled()
- numMemories()
- numTypes()

WasmBaselineCompile:
- tables
- types
- tags
- funcs
- globals
- memories
- offsetOfTagInstanceData()
- offsetOfTableInstanceData()
- funcIsImport()
- offsetOfFuncImportInstanceData()
- offsetOfTypeDefInstanceData()
- offsetOfSuperTypeVector()
- exnrefEnabled()
- tailCallsEnabled()
- gcEnabled()
- simdAvailable()
- v128RelaxedEnabled()
- memoryControlEnabled()
- sharedMemoryEnabled()
- isBuiltinModule()
- hugeMemoryEnabled()
- isAsmJS()
- offsetOfTypeDef()

WasmIonCompile:
- funcs
- memories
- types
- tables
- asmJSSigToTableIndex
- tags
- numFuncImports
- globals
- isAsmJS()
- offsetOfMemoryInstanceData()
- hugeMemoryEnabled()
- offsetOfTableInstanceData()
- offsetOfTagInstanceData()
- offsetOfSuperTypeVector()
- offsetOfTypeDefInstanceData()
- funcIsImport()
- offsetOfFuncImportInstanceData()
- usesSharedMemory()
- exnrefEnabled()
- gcEnabled()
- tailCallsEnabled()
- simdAvailable()
- v128RelaxedEnabled()
- memoryControlEnabled()
- sharedMemoryEnabled()
- isBuiltinModule()
- numMemories()
- offsetOfTypeDef()

WasmValidate:
- funcs
- types
- features
- tables
- memories
- globals
- tags
- imports
- exports
- startFuncIndex
- elemSegments
- dataCount
- codeSection
- numFuncImports
- dataSegments
- moduleName
- funcNames
- nameCustomSectionIndex
- customSections
- tailCallsEnabled()
- gcEnabled()
- simdAvailable()
- v128RelaxedEnabled()
- memoryControlEnabled()
- exnrefEnabled()
- sharedMemoryEnabled()
- numMemories()
- memory64Enabled()
- numTypes()
- numFuncs()
- declareFuncExported()
- numFuncDefs()
- init()

So. After all that, I think these are the parts of ModuleEnvironment that are used for function compilation:

```cpp
  // Constant parameters for the entire compilation:
  const ModuleKind kind;
  const FeatureArgs features;

  // Module fields decoded from the module environment (or initialized while
  // validating an asm.js module) and immutable during compilation:
  Maybe<uint32_t> dataCount;
  MemoryDescVector memories; // metadata
  MutableTypeContext types; // metadata
  FuncDescVector funcs;
  uint32_t numFuncImports;
  uint32_t numGlobalImports;
  GlobalDescVector globals; // metadata
  TagDescVector tags; // metadata
  TableDescVector tables; // metadata
  Uint32Vector asmJSSigToTableIndex;
  ModuleElemSegmentVector elemSegments; // only length / types used at compilation

  // The start offset of the FuncImportInstanceData[] section of the instance
  // data. There is one entry for every imported function.
  uint32_t funcImportsOffsetStart;
  // The start offset of the TypeDefInstanceData[] section of the instance
  // data. There is one entry for every type.
  uint32_t typeDefsOffsetStart;
  // The start offset of the MemoryInstanceData[] section of the instance data.
  // There is one entry for every memory.
  uint32_t memoriesOffsetStart;
  // The start offset of the TableInstanceData[] section of the instance data.
  // There is one entry for every table.
  uint32_t tablesOffsetStart;
  // The start offset of the tag section of the instance data. There is one
  // entry for every tag.
  uint32_t tagsOffsetStart;
```

And these are the ones that are _not_:

```cpp
  ImportVector imports;
  ExportVector exports;
  Maybe<uint32_t> startFuncIndex; // metadata
  MaybeSectionRange codeSection;

  // Fields decoded as part of the wasm module tail:
  DataSegmentEnvVector dataSegments;
  CustomSectionEnvVector customSections;
  Maybe<uint32_t> nameCustomSectionIndex;
  Maybe<Name> moduleName; // metadata
  NameVector funcNames; // metadata
```

So function-compilation stuff is indeed most of it.
