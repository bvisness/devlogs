# Bug 1885373 (indirect call metrics)

- [x] Patch immediates in ModuleGenerator
- [x] Track total metrics count in metadata
- [x] Allocate the actual storage for metrics
- [x] Verify that call_ref counts are working somehow
- [ ] Think about overflow of call counts in masm
- [ ] Think about how to limit number of metrics blocks
- [-] Track all the metrics
- [ ] Track other types of instructions besides call_ref
- [ ] Do a less jank type of vector on instances?
- [ ] Conditionally track metrics (don't emit in ion)
- [ ] Reduce storage size (pack things)
- [ ] Clean up TODOs

Documentation concerns:
- What kind of data we store in the metrics (any address inside a function's code?)
